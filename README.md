HOLLOW KNIGHT IS PEAK

In Hollow Knight, you will have fun exploring the Hallownest, trecking through the empty Forgotten Crossroads, the lush Greenery of Greenpath, and even the beautiful White Palace.
Though, you will have to fight enemy, ramping up in difficulty as you progress. Bosses can range from the easy False Knight, all the way to the painful Absolute Radiance.
There is even difficult platforming, like the infamous Path of Pain. As soon as you unlock Dash and Mantis Claw, you will be able to achieve an unlimited amount of platforming.
