HOLLOW KNIGHT IS A PEAK GAME

In Hollow Knight, you will have fun exploring the Hallownest, trecking through the empty Forgotten Crossroads, the lush Greenery of Greenpath, and even the beautiful White Palace.
Though, you will have to fight enemy, ramping up in difficulty as you progress. Bosses can range from the easy False Knight, all the way to the painful Absolute Radiance.
There is even difficult platforming, like the infamous Path of Pain. As soon as you unlock Dash and Mantis Claw, you will be able to achieve an unlimited amount of platforming.

The user will see an image of the Knight (our main character we play as) and the above text will be under the picture. There will be links to Mantis Claw, Dash and others, taking them to a page about the folllowing. When they see this page they will know more abote the peak game known as Hollow Knight. However it will be in a more hollow knight stly page rather than wikipedia.

The Dev will be able to see what pages the links take to, and all of other details that are hidden for whatever reason.
